# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, report it privately:

* Email: `nouridinelhofy@gmail.com`

We will respond within 3 business days. If you don’t receive a reply, you can follow up at the same address.

### Supported versions

* `main` — actively maintained
* (list older supported tags/versions if applicable)

### Disclosure timeline

We aim to triage and issue a fix promptly. After a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure.

For non-security questions, open a normal issue.
