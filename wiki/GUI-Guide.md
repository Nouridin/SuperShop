# A Player's Guide to the Shop Menus

SuperShop is controlled entirely through simple menus. This guide will show you how to master them!

## Your Shop's Control Panel

Once you've created a shop, right-clicking your shop chest opens the **Shop Management Menu**. This is your main hub for everything related to your shop.

**What you'll see:**

*   **At the top:** An overview of your shop, including its name, how many items it has, and if you have any sales revenue waiting for you.
*   **In the middle:** All the items you are currently selling.
*   **On the left:** Buttons to manage your shop:
    *   **Add Item**: Add a new item to sell.
    *   **Activate/Deactivate Shop**: Temporarily close or open your shop to customers.
    *   **Collect Revenue**: Collect the items other players have used to buy from you.
    *   **Remove Shop**: Permanently delete your shop.

**Managing Your Items:**

You can quickly manage items directly from this screen:

*   **Left-Click an item** to open the **Edit Item Menu** where you can change its price, quantity, and more.
*   **Right-Click an item** to quickly remove it from your shop and return it to your inventory.
*   **Shift-Click an item** to toggle whether it is available for sale or temporarily out of stock.

## Browsing and Buying from Other Shops

When you right-click another player's shop chest or select a shop from the `/searchbook` results, you'll open the **Shop Browse Menu**.

**What you'll see:**

*   **At the top:** Information about the shop, including the owner's name.
*   **In the middle:** All the items that are for sale.

**How to Buy:**

*   **Left-Click an item** to buy one of it.
*   **Shift-Click an item** to buy the entire stack.
*   **Right-Click an item** to open the **Purchase Amount Menu**, where you can type in a specific number to buy.

## Collecting Your Earnings

When a player buys something from you, their payment is stored in your shop as **revenue**. To collect it, open your **Shop Management Menu** and click the **"Collect Revenue"** button.

A new menu will open showing you all the items you've earned. Simply click the **"Collect All Revenue"** button, and all the items will be moved to your inventory!

## Managing All Your Shops from Anywhere

If you have multiple shops, you don't have to run to each one to manage them. Just type `/shop list` to open the **Shop Selection Menu**.

This menu shows all the shops you own. Simply click on any shop in the list to open its **Shop Management Menu** remotely, allowing you to add items, collect revenue, and manage it as if you were standing right there!
