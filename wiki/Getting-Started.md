# Getting Started with SuperShop

Ready to become a server merchant? This guide will walk you through the basics of creating and managing your very own shop.

## Step 1: Place a Chest

Find a good spot and place a regular, single chest. This chest will become your shop's inventory and is where you'll store the items you want to sell.

## Step 2: Create Your Shop

Look directly at the chest you just placed and type the following command in chat:

```
/shop create <Your Shop Name>
```

Replace `<Your Shop Name>` with a fun and descriptive name for your shop. For example:

```
/shop create The Diamond Market
```

Congratulations, your shop is now created!

## Step 3: Add Items to Your Shop

Right-click on your shop's chest to open the **Shop Management Menu**. This is your control panel for your shop.

1.  Click the **"Add Item"** button (the green emerald).
2.  In the new menu, drag the item you want to sell from your inventory into the empty slot in the middle.
3.  Click the **"Set Price Items"** button to choose what you want to be paid. You can select from a list of common items like diamonds, gold, or even bread!
4.  Once you've set your price, click the **"Add Item to Shop"** button.

That's it! Your item is now listed for sale. You can repeat this process to add more items to your shop.

## Step 4: Finding and Buying from Other Shops

Want to see what other players are selling? You can use the `/searchbook` command to find items for sale across the entire server.

For example, to search for diamonds, you would type:

```
/searchbook diamond
```

This will open a menu showing all the shops that are currently selling diamonds. Happy shopping!

Now that you know the basics, you can explore the other guides to learn about more advanced features, like editing your shop items and collecting your revenue.
