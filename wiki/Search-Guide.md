# Search Guide

This guide provides a detailed explanation of the search functionality in the SuperShop plugin.

## The Search Book

The primary way to search for items is by using the Search Book. You can obtain a Search Book by using the `/searchbook` command. Right-clicking with the Search Book in your hand will open the Search Input GUI, where you can enter your search query.

## Search Methods

SuperShop provides several ways to search for items:

*   **By Item Name**: You can search for items by their name. This is the most common way to search.
*   **By Material**: You can search for items by their material type.
*   **By Owner**: You can search for all items being sold by a specific player.

## Search Results

After you enter your search query, the search results will be displayed in the Search Book GUI. The results are sorted by distance, with the closest shops appearing first.

From the search results, you can:

*   **Teleport to the shop**: If you have the `supershop.teleport` permission, you can teleport directly to the shop.
*   **View the item in the shop**: You can open the Shop Browse GUI to view the item and other items in the shop.
